LayersMachine.js for Ethereum

We all own a car consuming oil.
To convert all those cars to electricity isn't a real revolution, it is just a Technology Turnover.
A REAL REVOLUTION is when you wipe out the need for cars.

It's time to turn upside down the geopolitics of Exchange-Platforms with the revolution of  Exchangeless HyperCoins and HyperLayer! A new Autonomous world working without third party agents.

Everything is under construction, so please take the code as-is, and wait for some decent instructions.
The smart contracts behind the HyperLayer are under test and will be published as soon as possible.

INTEGRATED ETHEREUM CONSOLE

GOALS:

Create Flood HyperCoin Minter. HyperCoins are ERC 20 special tokens you can swap WITHOUT THIRD PARTY EXCHANGE PLATFORMS. Flood will bring cutting edge cryptos to the masses, delivering an Integrated ICO Platform in each HyperCoin. Prepare for the flooding!


Create Layers:Machine.js Browser in order to browse the HyperLayer, the Autonomous Exchange Layer resulting from the connections between HyperCoins. Traders will be able to trade in total autonomy (no third party platform = no owners = zero fees )

Transform HyperLayer into a Social Platform, coin managers will be able to deal with their community.

Do what Zuckerberg would never do: building an inner indeed-very-simple Decentralized Advertising System and Fill The Wallets Of Social Users

[ future ICO ] Transform Hyperlayer into a  wordpress of coins, adding SmartLayer with Dapps Market. Developers will sell smart modules, coin managers will buy and EXTEND their Hypercoins superpowers. All the community will consume dapps and general smartware, filling this missing link along with traders and general community consumers, gathering all the Ethereum Population under one lovely roof.



MEANWHILE

Involving all possible hackathon camps into Layers:Machine.js
Finding the right name for the final Social Platform

EDIT:
will integrate Etherecho blockchain based messaging (please see relative camp)
will integrate EtherRe.al Social Graph and finally base the open social network on it (please see relative camp)

STATUS:
Coin Minter ready (each HyperCoin comes with an integrated ICO platform)
HyperCoins missing hyperfunctions
LayersMachine.js advancing like a storm
