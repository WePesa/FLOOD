LayersMachine.js for Ethereum

We all own a car consuming oil.
To convert all those cars to electricity isn't a real revolution, it is just a Technology Turnover.
A REAL REVOLUTION is when you wipe out the need for cars.

It's time to turn upside down the geopolitics of Exchange-Platforms with the revolution of  Exchangeless HyperCoins and HyperLayer! A new Autonomous world working without third party agents.

Everything is under construction, so please take the code as-is, and wait for some decent instructions.
The smart contracts behind the HyperLayer are under test and will be published as soon as possible.

LayersMachine will transform Ethereum into a Social Network
Are you building a project on Ethereum?
LayersMachine will be a WEB2+WEB3 interface.
This is not Facebook... I would like to integrate your project into LayersMachine and give you all my traffic.
Contact me!


I am working on the hyper-logic of the system, please stay tuned.
